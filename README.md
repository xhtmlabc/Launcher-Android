# Anime Game APK Proxy
This code source is from [577fkj](https://github.com/577fkj) ,which is currently source code has been closed since version 1.7 because they don't want people to use this app for buying private server accounts. here I am just fixing the code so that it can be supported with version 2.8 including being able to login to a custom server without having to use a modified apk made in China which only allows using their server.

## Bug (Need your help)
I've done some testing on several phones mine have it all working without problems. it's just that some other players still often get the error message "Failed to Extract il2cpp" which I can't fix because I don't have a phone that has the same error. so i need you guys to fix this :)

## Do not do this
Please don't use this app to sell private server accounts, or any other weird thing because it's supposed to be free. If I find someone selling private server accounts I'll probably be shut down forever.
